Hi everyone :p
  
  Welcome to my personal website. 
  
  I'm currently a 1st Year MS Biostatistics at Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health. From [this page](education.html), you can know a bit more on my education background. And my other extracurricular experience can be accessed [here](extracurricular.html).   
  
  The answer to homework 4 problem 2 can be found [here](hw4_dashboard.html).
