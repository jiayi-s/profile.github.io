  Sylvia is a PhD student in Biostatistics at Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California. She is born and raised in Shanghai, and she's also lived in Singapore, London and New York for a couple of years. She loves to travel and explore fun things to do in cities. A new hobby of hers since moving to southern California is hiking. (California sunshine is more than amazing!)
