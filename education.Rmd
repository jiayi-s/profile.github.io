## RESEARCH
**Identifying Distant Human-Yeast Orthologue Genes on PomBase**\
*09/2017-03/2018, London, UK*\
- Retrieved distinct homologous amino acid sequence of yeast gene products using multiple sequence alignment tools, including BLAST and DIOPT \
- Analyzed and reviewed gene sequence and relevant literature of 470 gene products as results returned from the bioinformatics tools \
- Identified 10 pairs of putative human-yeast orthologs. All the predictions have been published on [Pombase.com](https://www.pombase.org/).
